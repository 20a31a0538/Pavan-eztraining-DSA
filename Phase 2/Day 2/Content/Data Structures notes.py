#Data Structure ---> 2 types : linear & non linear
#linear : storing data in sequence manner (array, linked_List, stack, queues, matrix)
#non linear : storing data not in sequence manner(tree, graph, heap, hash table)

#linear : 2 types --> static(arrays)-->fixed size & dynamic(list, stack, queue)--> no fixed size
#non linear : 2types -->graph ,tree


#linkedlist:  ---> example : Train
#as name says list of items which are linked with one & other
#TYpes: 3 types --> singly , Doubly , Circular

#creating a linkedList :

#step 1: create the node
#step 2: partition the node with two segments --> data & None
#step 3: Add value into the blank Node(none)
#step 4: mark the node as head
#step 5 : create the next node by following above steps
#           1. establish link between 1st and 2nd node

#displaying     linkedLIST:
#traversal is required from first node till tail node in order to display existing linked list
